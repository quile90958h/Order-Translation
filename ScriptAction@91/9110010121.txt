＠Arturia
I told you that I wanted to see Fuyuki, and you indulged me of my selfish request.[r] You all have my thanks.

＠Arturia
Let’s return to Chaldea, Master。[r]I expect that there are other things that we should be doing at this time。
[k]

？1：Yeah, you have a point。

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mashu
Please wait。[r]You haven’t finished your story from before。
[k]

？2：……Before we do that, there’s one more thing I have to ask。

[charaFace D 0]
＠Arturia
One more thing……？
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Arturia
Ah, that’s right。 I told you details behind me becoming king、[r]but I still haven’t told you about my reason for becoming king。
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Arturia
My reason for taking up the throne and rushing into battle, despite the fact the fact that I possess the body of a young girl。[r]……For what purpose did I fight for?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Arturia
However, that is an easy answer to an easy question。[r]I certainly fought for the same reasons that you fight for now、Master [%1]。
[k]

＠Arturia
I didn’t fight for the sake of my ideals。[r]I fought for the sake of the future。
[k]

＠Arturia
It’s something that anyone would naturally wish for。[r]For the sake of protecting that future, I outstretched this hand of mine and took up my blade。
[k]

＠Arturia
I cannot judge whether or not I skillfully accomplished this task. [r]But I sacrificed as I much as I could of myself for the sake of that dream.[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mashu
……You’re saying that King Arthur had no regrets in her final moments？
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Arturia
I do feel remorse, but I have no regrets.
[k]

＠Arturia
The battle that I fought wasn’t the correct solution to save everything,[line 3][r]but it wasn’t incorrect, either. I’m already aware of this, after all.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Arturia
And from this point on, we have your battle to fight, Master。[r]I swear on this holy sword of mine that I will aid you in whatever way I can.[k]
