This place is the grounds upon which the Holy Grail War began. The Land of Fuyuki...

＠Arturia
It’s a rather cruel thing.[r]This blaze probably won’t disappear from this place in 10 or even 20 years。
[k]

＠Arturia
Its curse has been ingrained deep within the soil itself。[r]This is no longer a place where people may live。

＠Dr. Roman
It seems that way, doesn’t it？[r]There looks to be a town that resembles this very one in America, as well。
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
A fire ravages the surface and gases permeate the underground. [r]It’s expected to continue burning for five more years, or something along those lines。
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Well、that instance is one brought about by human hands; an accident that occurred during the city’s development.[r]This instance is a calamity born from magic, however。

＠Arturia
A calamity born from magic……[r]What are your thoughts on the matter, Master？
[k]

？1：This is definitely the fault of the Holy Grail. 


[charaFace D 4]
＠Arturia
So the Holy Grail is the cause of this. ......Part of me wants to refute this claim、but this is a truth that I cannot deny。
[k]

？2：This is due to this place becoming a singularity.

[charaFace D 0]
＠Arturia
Then the Holy Grail is not the cause.[r]The fact that this place became a singularity is what changed this city’s situation in such a way？
[k]

……Ummm。[r]The one who protected this city’s Holy Grail was you, Saber。
[k]

＠Mashu
Or if I were to speak more accurately, a different side of you. However,[r]do you have any recollection of that time？
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Arturia
……Please forgive me。
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Arturia
When we Heroic Spirits are summoned as Servants, we are independent from our original forms during that point in time。
[k]

＠Arturia
When our contract ends and we are returned to the Throne of Heroes, then all of our personal experiences are accumulated as records to be integrated within the throne. However......
[k]

＠Arturia
My current self is of the Saber class. This me comes from a time where I disciplined myself as the King of Knights.
[k]

＠Arturia
[%1]、Mashu. Please think of the me that you saw in that black armor as a different person from myself as I am now。

＠Dr. Roman
Yeah. That feature is the Heroic Spirit Summoning System’s strong point as well as its weak point.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It’s able to utilize various sides of a single Heroic Spirit. On the other hand, it’s also possible that you may have to compete against that same Heroic Spirit as well。

However, please be at ease. Even more so than that me that had fallen into darkness being of a different class, [r]I assure you that no matter what may happen, I will never change。
[k]

＠Arturia
I will wield this sword of mine for the sake of your goal. [r]Even if I’m mistaken in what I said before, I will never turn this sword against any of you。
[k]

？1：That’s very promising。

？2：Of course, I’ll put my trust in you。

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Arturia
Yes, you have my thanks, Master。[r]Now then、let us face the situation at hand and respond to that trust.[k]

That growl, just now......![r]That was a hostile response, Senpai!
[k]

＠Arturia
It looks as though this will become some fine battle experience, doesn’t it? [r]Mashu, come and stick close to me. I’ll teach you the ways of battle!
