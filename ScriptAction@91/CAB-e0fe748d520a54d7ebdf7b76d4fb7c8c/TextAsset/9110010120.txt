As I expected, you have a well-toned body。[r]Mashu will become a fine warrior、[%1]。

＠Arturia
……Well。[r]That slightly timid side of you is a problem that we’ll have to work on from now on, however。
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mashu
……Sorry。[r]Fighting is as frightening as I expected

＠Mashu
You weren’t scared, Saber-san？[r]Even you’re a girl and around the same age as me?[line 3]

＠Dr. Roman
Yeah、I’m interested in that as well。
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Learning that the King Arthur of legend was actually a young girl surprised me as well、but what really surprised me was that strength of yours。
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
I believe that the quality of Saber’s......that the quality of Arturia’s spiritual origins are top-class even among Heroic Spirits。
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Arturia......No, King Arthur.[r]How did you go to such lengths without hesitating?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Going as far as to disguise yourself as a man to take up the king’s throne、[r]uniting Britain in the midst of its ruin、and driving away the foreign warriors that invaded your land。
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Your reasons for showing such determination. The circumstances that forced you to take up your position. I can’t help but to wonder about these things.

＠Arturia
……My reasons and the circumstances behind them?[r]I see。Reasons aside, I can certainly explain the circumstances.[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Arturia
I was a child born to...no. I was a child that was manufactured for the sake of putting a foolish, preceding ruler to death. [k]

＠Arturia
It seems to be a magic known as『Concept Conception.』
[k]

＠Arturia
My mother conceived the concept of “The Red Dragon that will safeguard Britain.”, and gave birth to me as a result
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Arturia
The high quality of my spiritual origins is probably thanks to that。[r]Thereafter, I drew the sword that would determine who would become king.
[k]

＠Arturia
I was chosen by the sword...and I was assisted by Merlin...a troubling magus that also served as my inheritor.[k]

＠Arturia
I received this holy sword from the Lady of the Lake and had begun governing Britain.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Arturia
That is all that there is to the story of my past。[r]It’s just like the legends say.
[k]

＠Arturia
The small detail that is different from your perceptions has to do with the fact I’m a different gender from the King Arthur of legend, right?
[k]

＠Arturia
I mean, when it comes to governing a country, it is somewhat more convenient to rule it as a man, after all.[k]

？1：Wasn’t it difficult？

？2：……Do you have any regrets？

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Arturia
Of course. It was quite difficult, and I had made many mistakes。[r]My life was not one that was composed simply of comfort.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Arturia
However, I was happy with life that I led.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Arturia
I had walked many a mistaken road along the way、[r]but I had finally realized that fact at the very end。
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Aruturia
I had damaged many things and suffered unexpected defeat during my lifetime. [r]But the thing which I thought was the most noble was the fact that I protected Britain until the very end.
[k]

Master, give me your orders. [r]Let’s drive away the curse that ingrains itself in this land once and for all!
